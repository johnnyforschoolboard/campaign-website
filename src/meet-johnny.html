                My story begins in Corpus Christi, Texas, where I was the son of an army combat veteran and a nurse. I spent my younger years pursuing athletics, and even earned a baseball scholarship to a junior college in Kansas. I then spent my 20s pursuing my dreams of becoming a musician, where I had the pleasure of playing on stage both locally and nationally. I then made the best decision I could have, and returned to college to finish my education. Eventually, I earned both a bachelorâ€™s degree and masters degree from Texas State University in San Marcos. While at Texas state, I became a graduate assistant and a teaching assistant, where I was offered the opportunity of teaching my own course in American Government. Finally, after marrying the love of my life and having two wonderful children, I settled in the great city of Kyle, Texas. It was here where I fell in love with this wonderful community, and it was here where I took a great interest in local issues, especially those concerning the well being of our citizens. While spending the last few years of my life teaching 7th, 8th and 9th grade history, I have had the pleasure of pursuing my love of educating children.
