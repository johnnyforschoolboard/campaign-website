        There are many obstacles that children are faced with in Hays County,
        and these challenges have become more apparent than ever in the last
        couple of years. I hope to focus my campaign on issues that all parents
        care about in district 2, such as the safety of our schools and our
        students, especially in the face of the fentanyl crisis that has arisen
        in our community.
      </p>

      <p class="issue-paragraph">
        I propose an all hands on deck approach to this issue, so that no family
        has to endure the pain of losing a child. Secondly, I want to provide
        our students, teachers and administrators with the resources they need
        to succeed. In the face of massive growth east of I-35, it is imperative
        that both our facilities and staff are equipped with all things
        necessary to provide students with quality education.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="issue-paragraph">
        Also, there is nothing more important to our kids' education than the
        sustainability of our hardworking teachers. In the face of massive
        resignations of educators all across the county, it is vital that we not
        only pay our teachers what they deserve, but provide them with enough
        days to maintain a healthy work life balance.
      </p>
      <br>
